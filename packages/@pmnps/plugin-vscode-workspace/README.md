# @pmnps/plugin-vscode-workspace

You might be troubled by the problem about `can not find tsconfig` in projects, when using `pmnps`. 
This plugin will run in refresh command, it creates a `.code-workspace` file, so, we can use `pmnps` more better in vscode, and resolve the `can not find tsconfig` problem.

If you are not familiy with `vscode multi workspace`, please take this [reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces).
